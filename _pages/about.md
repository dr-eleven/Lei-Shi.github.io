I'm a first-year Ph.D. student from [School of CSE](https://cs.njust.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://www.njust.edu.cn/). My research interests include graph neural networks, machine learning robustness, and graph representation learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Li](https://zechao-li.github.io/) of Image Lab from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.njust.edu.cn/), Nanjing University of Science and Technology. Previously, I received my Master's degree from [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://www.njust.edu.cn/).
